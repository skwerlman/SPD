SPD
===
__Submitted Picture Downloader__

Downloads every image a redditor has ever submitted.
Currently only works with images uploaded to [imgur](//imgur.com) or [gfycat](//gfycat.com).

Let me know if you need it to work with another site.

#### USAGE
```
./spd.py <redditor name>
```

#### NOTES

You need to have `wget` installed and in your path for this to work.

I have not tried to make this work in Windows, so there may be issues with that.

If SPD downloads an html document by accident, let me know so I can fix it.
