SPD
===
Submitted Picture Downloader

Downloads every image a redditor has ever submitted.
Currently only works with images uploaded to [imgur](//imgur.com) or [gfycat](//gfycat.com).

Let me know if you need it to work with another site.

You need to have `wget` installed and in your path for this to work.



#### USAGE
```
./spd.py <redditor name>
```
